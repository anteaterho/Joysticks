There are 2 files in this folder

- Unity project folder with all the mappings of the buttons
- 'JoystickDemo.exe' build


In order for your joystick to work with Unity. 
Please plug it into your computer before starting Unity.

The mappings of your joystick will show up at when you run the 
'JoystickTest.exe' file. 

It will tell you what button it is in this format "joystick button #" (how Unity recognizes  it)
It will also show you the raw data of your axis, as well as the name that Unity takes inside its Input Manager.

The project is a sample of how the Input manager works and how to trigger them in the script.
Please do not alter those attributes in the folder.

Thanks,

Team Unity.
